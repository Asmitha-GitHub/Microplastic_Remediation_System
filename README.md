### 🌊 Hybrid ROV for Microplastic Waste Filtration & Collection

**📝 Project Overview**
This project focuses on designing a Hybrid Remotely Operated Vehicle (HROV) that can automatically detect, collect, and filter plastic waste (including microplastics) from freshwater bodies. The goal is to reduce water pollution while ensuring that only clean water is returned back into the environment.

**✅ What We Implemented**

**Mechanical Collection & Filtration System**
– Designed and prototyped a filtration mechanism where water is sucked using a DC mini underwater pump, passed through a fine mesh filter, and plastics are separated while clean water is returned.
– Engineered a one-way drainage valve to ensure a smooth flow and prevent system clogging.
– Built an automatic storage mechanism to move separated plastics into a storage compartment without manual intervention.

**Movement & Navigation**
– Integrated brushless DC motors with propellers for underwater movement.
– Powered the HROV with a 12V battery for continuous operation and mobility.

**Sensing & Detection**
– Utilized ultrasonic sensors to detect and autonomously avoid obstacles.
– Integrated a camera sensor with a machine learning model to identify plastics in water.

**Location Tracking**
– Incorporated a GPS module to track and monitor the location of the HROV during operation.

**Prototype Demonstration**
– Tested a working prototype in a controlled environment to demonstrate the plastic-water separation process.

### 🚀 Next Steps (Planned Improvements)
– Advanced Filtration: Implement multi-layer mesh filters to capture smaller plastic particles and microplastics without clogging.
– Smart Automation: Upgrade with IoT connectivity for remote monitoring and data collection.
– Scalability: Extend the system for larger ponds and lakes with improved motor power and robust storage.
– AI Enhancement: Improve the ML plastic detection model for higher accuracy and real-time decision-making.
